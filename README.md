# mastermind
Mastermind game clone, written in Ruby.

Rules:

It generates random code from RGBY in XXXX format for example: YYGB.

Your job is to guess it in 12 rounds.

After each round feedback will be given.

  1 - good color, and good position

  0 - good color, but wrong position

Lack of feedback means wrong color and wrong position.
